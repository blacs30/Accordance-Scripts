# Accordance-Scripts
Script that automate stuff in and around accordance

# How to use
Copy the source code into the Apple Script Editor on your Mac and run it.

## Import User Tool
The import user tool will just open a window where the location with all TXT files to import should be chosen.
It will iterate and import all the files into Accordance.
Be aware that Accordance as of version 12 cannot handle very good a huge amount of User Tools.
Separate them in subfolders in the User Tool section.
